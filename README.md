# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to create a neural network model for our investment firm. This model will enable the firm to predict the success of future investments using a binary classifier. Using historical data our model will help us determine which investments will be most likely to succeed.

## Summary

In conclusion, our model was only able to reach a 72.4% accuracy rating at a loss of 55.5%. I would not recommend moving forward with this present model as both our accuracy and loss percentages do not meet our sufficient standards. I recommend that we dive deeper into our data looking for more noisy variables and potentially looking into including more data into our sample. After this we can work on including more hidden layers and nodes in order to pursue at least 90% accuracy.
